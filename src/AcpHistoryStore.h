// Designed to live on its own QThread (owned by AcpAgentManager in Group 4),
// but works on any thread provided callers respect Qt thread-affinity by
// invoking the public slots via QMetaObject::invokeMethod or queued signals.
//
// Writes are debounced per session (500 ms single-shot timer). Calling
// `scheduleWrite` for the same session repeatedly within the debounce window
// REPLACES the pending payload — only the last payload is flushed (this
// matches the model's "rebuild full snapshot on every mutation" approach).
//
// On successful flush the store emits `flushed(sessionId)`. This signal is
// part of the public API — callers (notably tests) use QSignalSpy to wait
// for write completion deterministically.
