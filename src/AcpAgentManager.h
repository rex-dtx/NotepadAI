// Top-level owner of the ACP subsystem. Owned by NotepadNextApplication.
//
// Responsibilities:
//   - Owns the single AcpAgentRegistry instance (so settings dialog + spawn
//     paths share the same registry).
//   - Owns the AcpHistoryStore worker thread.
//   - Tracks live sessions (connection + model + dock) keyed by sessionId.
//   - Provides the entry point used by MainWindow to spawn a new agent
//     instance against a given working directory.
//   - Runs an idle reaper that destroys connection+model for sessions whose
//     dock has been closed for more than 1 hour.
//   - Provides a synchronous shutdown() that flushes the history worker and
//     joins its thread.
