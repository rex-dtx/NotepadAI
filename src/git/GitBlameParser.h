// Decoder for `git blame --porcelain` output. The porcelain format is
// machine-stable across git versions and is the only mode that yields
// per-line metadata without ambiguous whitespace parsing.
//
// The format is naturally denormalised: the first occurrence of a commit in
// the stream carries the full author/summary block; subsequent occurrences
// only repeat the header. We normalise on the way in — author/summary live
// in `records`, lines reference them by index — so a file with 10k lines
// authored by 5 commits costs 5 * (Author + Summary) + 10k * (qint32, qint32).
