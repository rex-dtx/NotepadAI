# NotepadAI

A fast, cross-platform code editor with built-in AI agents, Git integration, and an embedded terminal. Built on [Notepad Next](https://github.com/dail8859/NotepadNext) (a Notepad++ reimplementation in Qt/C++).

## Features

- **AI Agent Integration** — Chat with Claude Code, Gemini, or any ACP-compatible agent directly inside the editor. Agents can read/write files, run terminal commands, and understand your workspace context.
- **Git Integration** — Inline blame, gutter diff indicators, commit history viewer, staging/unstaging, branch picker, and file-tree decorations. No external Git GUI needed.
- **Embedded Terminal** — Full PTY terminal with mouse reporting, image passthrough, and persistent task registry. Open terminals in workspace or file directory.
- **Notepad++ Compatibility** — Familiar tabbed interface, syntax highlighting for 80+ languages via Scintilla/Lexilla, macro recording, session management, and Notepad++ config import.
- **Lightweight & Fast** — Native C++20/Qt 6 with zero-copy hot paths, precompiled headers, and Control Flow Guard. Starts in milliseconds.
- **Cross-platform** — Windows, Linux (AppImage), and macOS (dmg).

## Installation

Download binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/nullmastermind/NotepadAI/releases) page.

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| Windows  | Installer (.exe) or portable zip |
| Linux    | AppImage |
| macOS    | Disk image (.dmg) |

## Building from Source

Requirements: CMake 3.21+, Qt 6.5+, Ninja, a C++20 compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang).

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
```

See [doc/Building.md](doc/Building.md) for platform-specific details.

## AI Agents

NotepadAI speaks the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](doc/AcpAgents.md) over stdio. The default built-in agent is Claude Code. Add custom agents via Settings with any command that implements ACP's JSON-RPC 2.0 wire format.

## Multi-Instance / Portable Mode

NotepadAI supports running multiple independent instances, each with its own settings, sessions, and AI history. This is useful when you want separate profiles (e.g., work vs personal) without data conflicts.

All application data is stored under `<data-dir>/NotepadAI/` (settings INI, session backups, ACP chat history).

### Custom data directory

Set a custom data directory using one of these methods (highest priority first):

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| CLI flag | `NotepadAI.exe --data-dir=D:\profiles\work` |
| Environment variable | `NOTEPADAI_DATA_DIR=D:\profiles\work` |
| Portable marker | Create an empty file named `portable` next to the exe |
| Preferences UI | Settings > Data Directory > Browse |

Relative paths are resolved relative to the executable's directory.

When two instances use different data directories, they run as fully independent processes (separate settings, sessions, window state, and SingleApplication identity). Instances sharing the same data directory still behave as a single instance (the second forwards its files to the first).

### Portable mode

Place an empty file named `portable` next to `NotepadAI.exe`. The application will store all data in the same directory as the executable — no writes to `%APPDATA%` or system directories. Ideal for USB drives or self-contained deployments.
